# Lead-vehicle slowdown and ADS following response

Tests following distance and braking when a lead SUV slows down.

## Recorded result

The ADS braked and exhibited stop-and-go motion. Minimum reviewed clearance was approximately 1.19 m, with no contact. Recorded ticks: **502**. Termination: **`scenario_completed`**.

The ADS represents the following vehicle in the source report. The lead vehicle's target speed decreases from 3.8 to 2.4 m/s, with a measured peak deceleration of approximately 3.71 m/s². This variant does not reproduce a complete lead-vehicle stop.

## Replay

Complete the [runtime setup](../../REPRODUCE.md) first. From the separate Crash2OpenX toolchain directory:

```sh
CASE_DIR="/absolute/path/to/crash2openx-scenarios/scenarios/262_Zoox_February_11_2023"
uv run python tools/carla_remote.py run \
  --xodr "$CASE_DIR/map.xodr" --xosc "$CASE_DIR/scenario.xosc" \
  --scene-seed "$CASE_DIR/scene_seed.json" --road-seed "$CASE_DIR/road_seed.json" \
  --pcla-agent if_if --sut-actor hero --rgb-actor-role hero --max-seconds 600
```

For a configured local Linux GPU host, use `tools/carla_local.py` with the same arguments. The log is the unchanged original wrapper log, including all scenario subprocess output; it records this run's actual termination, which can be collision exit or timeout. New runs may produce different ADS trajectories and outcomes.
